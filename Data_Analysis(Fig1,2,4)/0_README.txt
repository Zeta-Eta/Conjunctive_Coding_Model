Hints for using the scripts：

a0_DataScreening.m -  preprocessing of raw data           
a1_DataManipulations.m  -   generate data and files needed for plotting             
a2_Batch_Introduction.m  -   descriptions for plotting scripts，open this file and see how other scripts work

Folders: 
Data  -   where data files are saved
DataManipulations - functions used in processing
AccuracyAndRT - where the table of accuracy and RT of each session/participant is saved
CorrelationSchool - the analysis of correlation between task performance and school performance of children
Figure - a folder for saving output figures
